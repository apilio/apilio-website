					<p><em>Effective date: May 13, 2019</em></p>

					<p>
						Apilio Ltd. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Apilio services (hereinafter referred to
						as the "Service").
					</p>
					<p>
						This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of
						personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to
						the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise
						defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
						meanings as in our <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>, accessible from
						http://www.apilio.com
					</p>

					<h4>Definitions</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>Service</strong><br />
						Service is the http://www.apilio.com website operated by Apilio Ltd.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Personal Data</strong><br />
						Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data
						(or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our
						possession).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Usage Data</strong><br />
						Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or
						from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Cookies</strong><br />
						Cookies are small files stored on your device (computer or mobile device).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Data Controller</strong><br />
						Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in
						common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any
						personal information are, or are to be, processed. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy,
						we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Data Processors (or Service Providers)</strong><br />
						Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any natural or legal person who processes the
						data on behalf of the Data Controller. We may use the services of various Service
						Providers in order to process your data more effectively.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Data Subject (or User)</strong><br />
						Data Subject is any living individual who is using our Service and is the subject of
						Personal Data.
					</p>

					<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
					<p>
						We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and
						improve our Service to you.
					</p>

					<h5>Personal Data</h5>
					<p>
						Apilio currently only offers sign up and login via a Google account. When you do this, we
						are getting and storing the following personally identifiable information that can be used
						to contact or identify you ("Personal Data") from your Google profile. Personally
						identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Full Name</li>
						<li>E-Mail Address</li>
						<li>Your profile picture</li>
						<li>
							Application specific OAuth token (technical information necessary to perform the
							authentication with Google)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with additional personally
						identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data").
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional
						materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of
						receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link
						or instructions provided in any email we send.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note that you cannot opt-out of transactional (= non-promotional) e-mails such as
						invoices, receipts, important service notices, password reminders, etc.).
					</p>

					<h5>Configuration data</h5>
					<p>
						When you configure Apilio (i.e. creating elements like variables and logicblocks) we
						collect the information you put into the forms.
					</p>
					<p>This includes most notably:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your IFTTT maker key</li>
						<li>
							Names of the elements you create (variables, conditions and logicblocks)
						</li>
						<li>The identification strings of IFTTT applets</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Every time you update a variable or trigger a logicblock evaluation via a browser or
						through the API, we save the current state and timestamp of the change.
					</p>
					<p>We need to collect and store this information in order to be able to provide you with the service.</p>
					<p>
						Tip: You can obscure what data a variable holds, what a logicblock is about or what
						actions are executed: Just use cryptic names instead of speaking names (e.g. instead of
						giving a variable a name like "me_home" just call it "mh"). This will make the
						configuration a bit less intuitive for you but it will give you more privacy.
					</p>

					<h5>Usage data</h5>
					<p>
						We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data").
						This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address
						(e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you
						visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device
						identifiers and other diagnostic data.
					</p>
					<p>
						We create a log file of all http requests for analysing and debugging problems. The log
						file contains your IP address and other common http request data.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use Google Analytics to create statistical data about the feature usage of Apilio. Part
						of the data is collected by the standard integration code embedded into the web
						application. Another part is created by a custom interface that sends statistical data of
						the API usage directly from our backend servers to Google Analytics. No additional data
						that could be used to identify you is sent via that channel (i.e. no names or
						identifiable account information).
					</p>

					<h5>Tracking &amp; Cookies Data</h5>
					<p>
						We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and
						we hold certain information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique
						identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.
						Other tracking technologies are also used such as beacons, tags and scripts to collect and
						track information and to improve and analyse our Service.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
						sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of
						our Service.
					</p>
					<p>Examples of Cookies we use:</p>
