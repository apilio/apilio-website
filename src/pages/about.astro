	<TextImage
		title="Why we built <strong>Apilio</strong>"
		text="Mainstream platforms like IFTTT offer simple if-then rules — fine for basics, but not for real life. Home Assistant is powerful, but requires a server and technical skill. We built Apilio to fill the gap: powerful automation logic that anyone can set up, running in the cloud with no hardware to maintain. If you own smart devices from different brands and want them to work together intelligently, Apilio is for you."
