					<p><em>Last updated: May 13, 2019</em></p>

					<p>
						Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before
						using Apilio services (the "Service") operated by Apilio Ltd. ("us", "we", or "our").
						Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance
						with these Terms.
					</p>
					<p>
						These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By
						accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with
						any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.
					</p>

					<h4>Subscription</h4>
					<p>
						Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis
						("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis
						("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending
						on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. At the end of
						each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it or
						Apilio Ltd. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
						online account management page or by contacting Apilio Ltd. customer support team.
					</p>
					<p>
						A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall
						provide Apilio Ltd. with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
						address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By
						submitting such payment information, you automatically authorise Apilio Ltd. to charge all
						Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Apilio Ltd. will issue an
						electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline
						date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
						invoice.
					</p>

					<h4>Free Trial</h4>
					<p>
						Apilio Ltd. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a
						limited period of time ("Free Trial"). You may be required to enter your billing
						information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing
						information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Apilio Ltd.
						until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you
						cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription
						fees for the type of Subscription you have selected. At any time and without notice,
						Apilio Ltd. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial
						offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
					</p>

					<h4>Fee Changes</h4>
					<p>
						Apilio Ltd., at its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for
						the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
						then-current Billing Cycle. Apilio Ltd. will provide you with reasonable prior notice of
						any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription
						before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the
						Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
						Subscription fee amount.
					</p>

					<h4>Refunds</h4>
					<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

					<h4>Accounts</h4>
					<p>
						When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate,
						complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms,
						which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service. You are
						responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any
						activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a
						third-party service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must
						notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorised use of
						your account. You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that
						is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of
						another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorisation, or a name that
						is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. You expressly agree that we cannot be held
						liable for any loss or damage arising out of any misrepresentations you make in this
						regard.
