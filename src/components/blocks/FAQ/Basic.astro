				<Accordion
					title="What is a logicblock?"
					text="A logicblock is a combination of conditions and actions you create on Apilio to automate something. Conditions determine when actions execute — like triggering when it’s nighttime or temperature drops below 20°C. Actions represent outcomes such as controlling smart lights or heating systems."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="How frequently does Apilio process my events?"
					text="All plans process events every second. If your rate is higher than this, we might have to pause the offending logicblock to investigate."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="How many variables and conditions can I have?"
					text="Each plan includes a maximum number of active logicblocks, variables, and conditions. You can always save additional ones as inactive and swap them in when needed."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="What happens when I reach the maximum number of active logicblocks?"
					text="Additional logicblocks will be saved as inactive. You can activate different ones by deactivating others, or upgrade your plan for more capacity."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="Is there a free trial?"
					text="Yes — 21 days of full access, no credit card required. Try every feature before you decide. If you need more time, just get in touch and we’ll extend it for you."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="Will I be charged when the trial ends?"
					text="No, you won’t be charged unless you choose to subscribe to one of the plans. No credit card is required to start your trial."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="What happens after the trial?"
					text="Choose a plan to continue using Apilio. If you don’t subscribe, your account stays inactive for one month before being deleted."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="What happens if I don’t renew my plan?"
					text="Your account will be deactivated — IFTTT updates and actions will stop. Your configuration stays for one month before deletion, so you can resubscribe without losing your setup."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="Can I cancel anytime?"
					text="Yes, you can cancel anytime with just a click. You can also upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="Do you offer refunds?"
					text="Subscriptions are non-refundable, but we can convert unused time into credit for a new plan if you want to change tiers. Get in touch if you need help."
				/>
				<Accordion
					title="Discounts for charities or education?"
					text="Please get in touch — we’d like to support you if possible. Contact us at hello@apilio.com."
